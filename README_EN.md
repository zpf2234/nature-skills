- Hello everyone, I am Yizhe Yuan, the founder of `nature-skills`. Thank you for
  following this project. We have published many video tutorials on Douyin; you
  can search by topic name to find them, and I sincerely hope they help you.
- If you have a concrete need, please open an issue. If we think the request is
  meaningful and feasible, we will try to move it forward. Pull requests are also
  welcome; please follow the contribution format later in this document so that
  reviews, understanding, and merges can be handled efficiently. Please also
  record a matching usage tutorial for each PR.
- `nature-skills` collects general-purpose research skills for AI scholars
  worldwide. It is an early form of a "skill journal": the goal is not empty
  storytelling, but solving real domain problems.
- Knowledge Planet: `Nature Skills` and the philosophy behind it.

## Quick Start

After installation, you can give the agent a paper, paragraph, reviewer letter,
or task description directly. These prompts are ready to copy:

| Goal | Prompt |
| --- | --- |
| Read a paper / bilingual reader | `Turn this PDF into a figure-aware Chinese-English Markdown reader.` |
| Generate a paper presentation | `Create a Chinese journal-club PPT from this paper, keeping key figures and source labels.` |
| Polish or translate a manuscript paragraph | `Rewrite this Chinese paragraph into Nature-style academic English without changing the meaning.` |
| Draft an abstract, introduction, or discussion | `Using these results and figures, draft a Nature-style abstract and introduction.` |
| Simulate pre-submission review | `Evaluate this manuscript from a Nature reviewer perspective and produce three reviewer reports.` |
| Respond to reviewer comments | `Use this revision email to draft point-by-point replies, a cover letter, and redline locations for the revised manuscript.` |
| Search literature, strict citations, and citer profiles | `Create a table with this paper's citation count, strict external citation count, DOI, and whether major scholars or Fellows cited it.` |
| Create scientific figures or schematics | `Use this method and result description to draft a publication-ready scientific figure or manuscript schematic.` |

If you are unsure which skill to use, describe the task naturally. If you already
know the skill name, explicitly say "use `nature-reader`" or "use
`nature-response`" in the prompt.

# Some Personal Views

- Recently, I noticed that the Nature Skills design has drawn attention from
  Google DeepMind and has been referenced by them. They drew on its citation
  system, script ideas, and skill-design philosophy to launch Science Skills. To
  be honest, this makes me pleased: when leading international AI institutions
  begin to draw inspiration from our work, it means original ideas from Chinese
  developers are being seen by the world. This is not a feeling of loss from
  being copied, but a sign of Chinese strength taking root in open source and
  naturally growing outward.
- The focus of our skill design has never been to require every user to fully
  master the whole philosophy. The point is that the philosophy itself can be
  understood and reused by machines. If you want to create a new skill or adapt
  this system to your own field, you can give the Nature Skills GitHub repository
  to Codex and let it learn the design pattern, then help you create or modify a
  skill. This is how ideas become operational rather than remaining oral
  explanations.
- The real value of Nature Skills may not be limited to any individual module.
  It may be that the project has quietly opened a new door: many people realize
  for the first time that Codex or other agents can operate a local computer for
  research. I have been fortunate to witness and accompany many people through
  this shift in research workflow. When they say, "so research can be done this
  way," that break in understanding and liberation of thought matters more to me
  than the skills themselves. This is not merely the success of a tool, but the
  beginning of a new way of thinking spreading among people.
- In practice, almost every useful tool can be distilled into a standardized
  process, and standardized processes can be packaged as reusable skills.

## Installation

`nature-skills` is a collection of reusable skill packages organized around
`SKILL.md`. Each top-level skill directory under `skills/` is an installable unit,
such as `nature-*`; `nature-shared` is an installable support package read by
other skills.

### npx skills Installation

Install [Node.js 18 or later](https://nodejs.org/) first. The CLI does not need
to be installed globally. List the skill names available in this repository:

```bash
npx skills add Yuan1z0825/nature-skills --list
```

Install every skill globally for Codex. The complete selection includes
`nature-shared`, so skills that use the common references remain functional:

```bash
npx skills add Yuan1z0825/nature-skills --global --agent codex --skill '*' --yes --copy
```

Omit `--global` to install one independent skill in the current project:

```bash
npx skills add Yuan1z0825/nature-skills --agent codex --skill nature-figure --yes --copy
```

When installing `nature-reader`, `nature-paper2ppt`, `nature-polishing`, or
`nature-writing` alone, select the shared support package as well:

```bash
npx skills add Yuan1z0825/nature-skills --global --agent codex \
  --skill nature-reader --skill nature-shared --yes --copy
```

Install all skills for every agent supported by the CLI:

```bash
npx skills add Yuan1z0825/nature-skills --all
```

Verify the global Codex installation and update it later:

```bash
npx skills list --global --agent codex --json
npx skills update --global --yes
```

Update one skill, or update only the current project's skills:

```bash
npx skills update nature-reader --global --yes
npx skills update --project --yes
```

Pass the frontmatter name displayed by `--list` to `--skill`; for example, the
`nature-proposal-writer` directory is currently listed as `researchwrite`.
`npx skills` manages skill files only. Optional Python, R, browser, and MCP
runtime dependencies still need the separate setup described below.

### Claude Code Installation

Claude Code cannot use `scripts/update-codex-skills.sh` directly because that
script only syncs skills into Codex's `~/.codex/skills/`. For Claude Code, keep a
stable local clone and create a subagent or slash command wrapper that points to
the real `skills/*/SKILL.md`. This preserves the skill directory structure and
lets the workflow keep using `references/`, `static/`, `manifest.yaml`, scripts,
assets, and `skills/nature-shared/`.

If Claude Code is not installed yet:

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
claude
```

Clone the repository to a stable path:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/ai-skills
cd ~/ai-skills
git clone https://github.com/Yuan1z0825/nature-skills.git
```

Recommended method: create a Claude Code subagent wrapper for the skills you use
often. Example for `nature-reader`:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/agents
cat > ~/.claude/agents/nature-reader.md <<'EOF'
---
name: nature-reader
description: Use for Chinese-English paper reading, figure-aware translation, and source-grounded paper notes.
---

When invoked, first read `~/ai-skills/nature-skills/skills/nature-reader/SKILL.md` and follow it as the governing workflow.
Read supporting files from `~/ai-skills/nature-skills/skills/nature-reader/` and `~/ai-skills/nature-skills/skills/nature-shared/` only when needed.
Do not replace this skill with a generic paper-reading response.
EOF
```

Then start a new Claude Code session and ask for the subagent explicitly:

```text
Use the nature-reader subagent to turn this paper into a Chinese-English Markdown reader.
```

If you prefer a slash command, create a command wrapper instead:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/commands
cat > ~/.claude/commands/nature-reader.md <<'EOF'
Read `~/ai-skills/nature-skills/skills/nature-reader/SKILL.md` first and follow it strictly.
Read directly needed supporting files from `~/ai-skills/nature-skills/skills/nature-reader/` and `~/ai-skills/nature-skills/skills/nature-shared/`.

$ARGUMENTS
EOF
```

Use it inside Claude Code:

```text
/nature-reader Turn this paper into a full Chinese-English side-by-side Markdown reader.
```

To install other skills, replace `nature-reader` with the target directory name,
such as `nature-polishing`, `nature-writing`, `nature-reviewer`,
`nature-response`, or `nature-figure`. To update later:

```bash
cd ~/ai-skills/nature-skills
git pull
```

As long as the wrapper still points to this stable clone path, no repeated file
copy is needed.

### Claude Code Auto-Update (Optional)

If you want Claude Code to pull upstream updates automatically on every session
start, use `scripts/autoupdate-skills.sh` together with a `SessionStart` hook.

This approach **copies** the skills straight into `~/.claude/skills/` (Claude Code
auto-discovers that directory and loads each skill by its directory name) instead
of using the wrappers above. Pick whichever one you prefer.

Keep a **dedicated** stable clone (used only to sync skills — don't make dev
commits inside it):

```bash
mkdir -p ~/ai-skills
git clone https://github.com/Yuan1z0825/nature-skills.git ~/ai-skills/nature-skills
```

Install once, copying the skills into Claude Code's skills directory:

```bash
~/ai-skills/nature-skills/scripts/autoupdate-skills.sh --force
```

Then add a `SessionStart` hook to `~/.claude/settings.json` (merge this entry into
an existing `hooks` block rather than replacing it):

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "SessionStart": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "$HOME/ai-skills/nature-skills/scripts/autoupdate-skills.sh",
            "async": true,
            "timeout": 120
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

`async: true` runs it in the background so it never blocks startup. The script is
safe to run constantly: it skips the network if it already checked within the last
6 hours, silently skips when offline or the pull fails (`exit 0`, never stalling a
session), re-syncs only when the upstream HEAD actually changed, and refuses to
fast-forward a clone that has uncommitted changes. New skills take effect on the
**next** session (the current one already loaded its skills). Logs go to
`~/.local/state/nature-skills/autoupdate.log`.

The destination and check interval are both configurable, so Codex users can add
it to a shell profile or cron as well:

```bash
# Defaults to ~/.claude/skills; use --dest for another location, e.g. Codex:
~/ai-skills/nature-skills/scripts/autoupdate-skills.sh --dest ~/.codex/skills
# Check at most once per hour:
~/ai-skills/nature-skills/scripts/autoupdate-skills.sh --throttle 3600
```

### Codex Installation

Use the repository script to install or update Codex skills. It syncs every
top-level skill directory under `skills/` and verifies the copied contents with
`diff`. It does not overwrite unrelated Codex skills.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Yuan1z0825/nature-skills.git
cd nature-skills
scripts/update-codex-skills.sh --pull
```

If you already have a clone:

```bash
cd nature-skills
scripts/update-codex-skills.sh --pull
```

Verify that the current Codex installation matches this checkout:

```bash
scripts/update-codex-skills.sh --check
```

If you use this script for long-term updates and want to remove directories that
were previously managed by this installer but no longer exist upstream:

```bash
scripts/update-codex-skills.sh --pull --prune
```

`--prune` only removes directories recorded by this installer. It will not guess
or delete unrelated skills.

You can also ask Codex to install the repository for you:

```text
Install Codex skills from this repository:
https://github.com/Yuan1z0825/nature-skills.git

Clone the repository, run scripts/update-codex-skills.sh --pull, and then run
scripts/update-codex-skills.sh --check to verify the installation. Keep complete
skill directories under skills/; do not copy only SKILL.md.
```

To install only one skill, specify the skill name:

```text
Install only nature-reader from this repository:
https://github.com/Yuan1z0825/nature-skills.git

If the skill needs shared files, install skills/nature-shared as well.
```

Key rule: keep the full directory structure. Many skills depend on
`references/`, `static/`, `manifest.yaml`, scripts, assets, or shared files.

The installer does not install Python dependencies automatically. Install them
only when you need the corresponding scripts or MCP services:

```bash
python -m pip install -r skills/nature-paper-to-patent/requirements.txt
python -m pip install -r skills/nature-paper-to-patent/scripts/disclosure/requirements-cnipa.txt  # optional CNIPA published-patent search
python -m pip install -r skills/nature-academic-search/mcp-server/requirements.txt
```

If you enable `nature-paper-to-patent` CNIPA published-patent search, also run `python -m playwright install chromium`.

`nature-academic-search` also requires `PUBMED_EMAIL`. Optional Scopus,
ScienceDirect, and other provider credentials should be configured locally and
must not be committed to the repository.

After installation, start a new Codex session and describe your task naturally,
for example:

```text
Turn this paper into a full Chinese-English side-by-side Markdown reader.
```

```text
Create a Chinese PPT deck from this paper.
```

### Other Agent Scenarios

For OpenClaw, OpenCode, and Hermes, see the dedicated [integration guide](docs/open-source-agent-frameworks_EN.md).

For other agents, keep a stable repository clone and create a lightweight
subagent, slash command, or custom prompt wrapper that points to the real
`skills/*/SKILL.md` files. Preserve `skills/nature-shared/`.

For manual or other-agent use:

1. Copy complete skill directories into your prompt library or project.
2. Preserve `SKILL.md`, `manifest.yaml`, `static/`, `references/`, scripts,
   assets, and required `skills/nature-shared/` files.
3. If the target agent has its own format requirements, adjust the frontmatter
   and body structure.

## Shared Design Principles

1. **Prefer primary sources**: rules should be grounded in published Nature
   content, official journal guidance, or explicit local sources rather than
   generic taste.
2. **Make rules explicit**: explain the reason behind each rule instead of
   giving unsupported assertions.
3. **Respect section and task context**: writing, figures, citations, and
   responses depend on the manuscript section and task.
4. **Output first**: every skill should produce something directly usable, such
   as paste-ready text, `.svg`, `.pptx`, `.docx`, or concrete instructions.
5. **Keep skills extensible**: each skill should be self-contained, and adding a
   new skill should not require modifying existing skills.

---

## Adding a Skill

When adding a skill to this repository, follow this process.

### 1. Create Directory

```text
skills/nature-<topic>/
```

### 2. Minimum Files

| File | Required | Purpose |
|---|---:|---|
| `SKILL.md` | Yes | Frontmatter (`name`, `description`) plus rules and workflow loaded by the agent |
| `README.md` | Yes | Human-facing Chinese documentation |
| `README_EN.md` | Yes | English documentation paired with the Chinese details page |
| `references/*.md` | Recommended for complex skills | Modular rule files, API references, design theory, tutorials, chart types, and similar material |

### 3. README Writing Rules

Every new skill must include both `README.md` and `README_EN.md`. The README is a human-facing entry page, not a duplicate of `SKILL.md` and not an installation manual. Its job is to help users decide within 30 seconds whether the skill fits their task, what they need to provide, what it will output, and where its boundaries are.

Basic rules:

- The Chinese and English README files must be one-to-one mirrors: same heading count, same order, and same information points. Do not let the English page become a separate template.
- Start with the skill name, language switch link, and one positioning sentence.
- Use the base structure below by default; add optional sections only when they are genuinely needed.
- Do not repeat repository installation instructions, author bios, changelogs, development history, full file trees, or long internal implementation details inside a single skill README.
- Put complex rules, API parameters, long tutorials, script explanations, and template indexes in `references/`, `static/`, `scripts/`, or `SKILL.md`. Keep only navigational pointers in the README.
- If the skill has visual assets, a small preview table is fine; do not turn the README into a large gallery or long technical manual.

Chinese README base structure:

```markdown
# `nature-<topic>` 技能

[English](README_EN.md)

一句话说明这个技能的定位、主要任务和使用边界。

## 适合用它做什么
## 典型请求
## 你需要提供
## 产出
## 边界
## 相关技能
```

The English README must mirror it as:

```markdown
# `nature-<topic>` Skill

[中文说明](README.md)

One sentence describing the skill's role, main task, and usage boundary.

## What To Use It For
## Typical Requests
## What You Need To Provide
## Outputs
## Boundaries
## Related Skills
```

Optional sections must be inserted in both languages and in the same order. Common optional sections:

| Chinese Section | English Section | Use Case |
|---|---|---|
| `## 工作方式` | `## Workflow` | Explain the core workflow or routing behavior |
| `## 运行和依赖` | `## Runtime and Dependencies` | Scripts, MCP services, API keys, local config, or external dependencies |
| `## 示例预览` | `## Example Preview` | A few figures, screenshots, or visual assets are worth showing |
| `## 内置参考` | `## Built-In References` | Point to `references/`, `assets/`, or demos |
| `## 方法来源` | `## Method Sources` | Writing, review, or analysis rules come from specific sources |
| `## 三种模式` | `## Three Modes` | The skill has clear compose/revise/hybrid-style modes |
| `## 与 ... 的关系` | `## Relationship With ...` | The skill is easy to confuse with another skill and needs a division-of-labor note |

Before submitting, run at least these README checks:

```bash
git diff --check
for d in skills/nature-*; do
  [ -f "$d/README.md" ] && [ -f "$d/README_EN.md" ] || continue

### 4. Record a Usage Tutorial

When submitting a PR, please also record a short usage tutorial explaining what
problem the skill solves, how to trigger it, what inputs it needs, and what
outputs it produces. Add the video, screencast link, or public tutorial URL to
the PR description.

### 5. `SKILL.md` Frontmatter Template

```yaml
---
name: nature-<topic>
description: >-
  One sentence explaining what the skill does, when it should trigger, primary
  outputs, and core use cases.
---
```

### 6. Update Skill Index

After adding a skill, update the [Skill Index](#skill-index) table:

```markdown
| [`nature-<topic>`](skills/nature-<topic>/README_EN.md) | Draft / Stable | One-sentence purpose | Trigger terms | [Details](skills/nature-<topic>/README_EN.md) |
```

### 7. Status Labels

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `Draft` | Rules are defined but not yet tested on real cases |
| `Beta` | Tested on examples, with possible edge-case issues |
| `Stable` | Validated on real academic content and relatively stable |
