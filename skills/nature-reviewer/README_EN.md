# `nature-reviewer` Skill

[中文说明](README.md)

`nature-reviewer` simulates Nature-style pre-submission review from the reviewer perspective, helping authors find risks in novelty, significance, technical soundness, and reader value before submission.

## What To Use It For

- Stress-test a manuscript, abstract, figure set, or result storyline before submission.
- Evaluate originality, scientific importance, interdisciplinary readership, technical soundness, and readability using Nature-style review dimensions.
- Generate three differently focused reviewer reports and one cross-review synthesis.
- Mark unsupported claims, technical defects, evidence-chain breaks, and barriers for non-specialist readers.
- Use an internal 12-axis technical checklist and bind each substantive concern to a claim pointer and verifiable evidence location.
- Check redundancy across the three reports; treat an issue as consensus only when at least two reviewers raise it.
- Identify which readers would care about the work and why.

## Typical Requests

- "Review this introduction and Figure 1 like a Nature reviewer."
- "Before submission, find the technical issues reviewers are most likely to attack."
- "Give me three reviewer reports and one synthesis, not a rebuttal."

## What You Need To Provide

- Manuscript, abstract, key sections, figures, legends, or author notes.
- Target journal, field, and the review risks you are most worried about.
- Existing supplementary experiments or constraints on adding new experiments.

## Outputs

- Three peer-review style reports.
- Cross-review synthesis: consensus problems, divergent emphases, and editor-level risks.
- Traceable concerns with stable IDs, claim pointers, evidence pointers, and resolution tests.
- List of experiments, analyses, narrative changes, or figure evidence that must be strengthened.
- Explicit labels for judgments that cannot be made from the supplied evidence.

## Boundaries

- The skill does not invent specific reviewer identities, expert personas, or editorial decisions.
- It makes conservative simulations only from the provided material and the skill's official review rules.
- For writing responses to real reviewer comments, use `nature-response`.

## Related Skills

- `nature-response`: turn real reviewer comments into a response package.
- `nature-writing`: rebuild manuscript narrative based on review risks.
- `nature-statistics`: deeply audit statistical design and reporting.
