# Response structure

Use this file when drafting or auditing the output shape of a reviewer response package, revision cover letter, marked manuscript changes, or combined revision correspondence package.

## Default package

Return the response in this order unless the user asks for another format:

1. Response strategy summary.
2. Comment-response tracker.
3. Draft point-by-point response letter.
4. Draft revision cover letter when requested or when returning a combined revision package.
5. Marked manuscript changes when the user asks to edit the manuscript.
6. LaTeX deliverables when requested.
7. Manuscript change checklist.
8. Missing information / risk flags.
9. Chinese confirmation notes when the user writes in Chinese.

## Response strategy summary

Keep this short and editor-readable:

```text
Response strategy summary
- Decision type: Major revision
- Task mode: draft
- Parsed email metadata: manuscript ID and deadline found; required files include response letter and marked manuscript
- Package readiness: draft_with_placeholders
- Overall posture: Cooperative, evidence-forward, non-defensive
- Major risks: missing validation results; unclear replicate definition
- Suggested ordering: address editor first, then Reviewer 1 and Reviewer 2 in full
```

Decision types:

- `minor revision`
- `major revision`
- `revise-and-resubmit`
- `transfer after review`
- `appeal-like case` routed outside the default workflow
- `unclear` when the decision type is not supplied

Task modes:

- `draft`
- `audit`
- `revise`
- `triage-only`
- `cover-letter`
- `revision-package`
- `latex-template`
- `appeal-like`

Package readiness:

- `ready_to_submit`: no unresolved placeholders or missing facts remain.
- `draft_with_placeholders`: usable draft, but visible placeholders remain.
- `needs_author_input`: final text depends on facts the author has not supplied.
- `blocked`: credible revision response is blocked by ethics, compliance, data integrity, central evidence, or appeal-like routing.

## Comment-response tracker

Use a compact table:

```markdown
| ID | Reviewer concern | Type | Severity | Proposed action | Work status | Required input | Expected output | Blocks finalization? |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| R1.1 | Missing validation cohort | Evidence / validation | Major | ACCEPT_ANALYSIS | TODO_ANALYSIS | Validation result and location | Results text plus validation table | Yes |
```

Keep reviewer concern text short in the tracker. Preserve the full wording in the letter when available.
Use `E.1`, `E.2`, etc. for editor instructions and list them before reviewer comments.
When the input is a pasted editorial email, use the tracker to preserve all extracted required
revision items rather than only the reviewer comments.
Do not use `Work status` as a synonym for `Proposed action`: the former reports progress and verification, while the latter states the response strategy.
If the table becomes too wide for the requested medium, keep the same fields in a per-item block rather than dropping status, expected output, or blocking state.

## Point-by-point letter anatomy

Use this default structure:

```markdown
Dear Editor and Reviewers,

We thank the editor and reviewers for their careful evaluation of our manuscript.
We have revised the manuscript to address the concerns raised and provide a point-by-point response below.

## Response to Reviewer 1

**Reviewer comment R1.1**
[Full reviewer comment preserved here.]

**Response**
We thank the reviewer for raising this point. [Direct answer.]
To address this concern, we have [specific action]. This change appears in [section/page/line/figure].
[If pasting revised manuscript text, place it after the answer and format it in italics.]

**Revised manuscript text**
*[Paste revised manuscript text here.]*
```

For LaTeX or print-oriented response letters, start each new reviewer section on a new page. In
LaTeX, use `\ReviewerSection{1}`, `\ReviewerSection{2}`, etc. from
`templates/response-to-reviewers.tex`. Markdown drafts can note `[page break before Reviewer 2]`
when the final destination is a print/PDF response letter.

## Revision cover letter anatomy

Use the cover letter only when the user asks for it, the journal requires it, or the user asks for a complete revision package. Keep it shorter than the point-by-point response.

```markdown
Dear [Editor name],

Thank you for considering our revised manuscript, "[Manuscript title]" ([Manuscript ID]).
We appreciate the editor's and reviewers' constructive feedback.

In this revision, we have [major revision action 1], [major revision action 2], and [major revision action 3].
These changes address the main concerns regarding [concern/theme 1], [concern/theme 2], and [concern/theme 3].

We provide a detailed point-by-point response to all editor and reviewer comments below / in the accompanying response document.
We believe the revised manuscript is now clearer and better supported, and we hope it will be suitable for further consideration by [Journal name].

Sincerely,
[Corresponding author name]
on behalf of all authors
```

Do not use the cover letter to argue around unresolved reviewer concerns. If a major request remains unresolved, mention that the response letter explains the limitation.

## Marked manuscript changes

When modifying manuscript text, work on a copy of the original manuscript and mark changed passages in red. For LaTeX manuscripts, wrap changed text in `\revised{...}` from `templates/revised-manuscript-redline.tex`. For non-LaTeX outputs, use a clear red-text convention appropriate to the target format and keep a clean version separate from the marked copy.

In the response letter, after the direct answer, paste the revised manuscript text in italics. In LaTeX response files, use `\RevisedExcerpt{...}`.

## LaTeX deliverables

When the user asks for LaTeX, use the templates in `templates/`:

- `templates/cover-letter.tex` for revision cover letters.
- `templates/response-to-reviewers.tex` for point-by-point responses.
- `templates/revised-manuscript-redline.tex` for a red-marked manuscript-copy skeleton.

In `templates/response-to-reviewers.tex`, use `\ReviewerSection{...}` for each reviewer so
reviewer changes begin on a new page.

Preserve visible placeholders for unknown manuscript ID, editor name, line numbers, figure panels, dates, or author information. Do not hide missing facts in comments.

## Manuscript change checklist

List manuscript actions, not polite intentions:

```text
Manuscript change checklist
- R1.1: Add validation result summary to Results and cite Fig. 5.
- R1.2: Clarify replicate definition in Methods.
- R2.1: Soften causal claim in Abstract and Discussion.
```

## Missing information / risk flags

Use specific requests:

```text
Missing information / risk flags
- R1.1: Need validation result direction and effect/performance summary before final wording.
- R1.2: Need test name, replicate unit, sample size, and correction method.
- R2.1: No line numbers supplied; using section names for now.
```
