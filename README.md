## Installation

`nature-skills` is a repository of reusable instruction bundles centred on `SKILL.md`.
Each `skills/nature-*` directory is one installable unit. Copy the whole folder, not
only `SKILL.md`, because many skills depend on `references/`, assets, scripts, or
README context.

### 1. Codex

Codex can use these folders directly as local skills. This is the simplest installation path.

**Clone the repo**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Yuan1z0825/nature-skills.git
cd nature-skills
```

**Install one skill**

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.codex/skills
cp -R skills/nature-reader ~/.codex/skills/
```

**Install all current skills**

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.codex/skills
for d in skills/nature-*; do
  cp -R "$d" ~/.codex/skills/
done
```

**Update after pulling new changes**

```bash
git pull
for d in skills/nature-*; do
  cp -R "$d" ~/.codex/skills/
done
```

**Finish**

- Restart Codex so newly added skills are picked up.
- Then ask naturally, for example: `Translate this paper into a full markdown reader.` or
  `Make this paper into a Chinese journal-club PPT.`

If you prefer not to use the terminal, copying the `skills/nature-*` folder(s) into
`~/.codex/skills/` manually works as well. For a longer walkthrough, see
[`install.md`](install.md).

### 2. Claude Code

**Primary method: Plugin marketplace installation**

This repository is published as a Claude Code plugin, making installation simple.

```bash
# Add the marketplace (one-time)
/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/Yuan1z0825/nature-skills

# Install the plugin
/plugin install nature-skills

# Reload to apply
/reload-plugins
```

All nine skills are available automatically after reload. No manual wrapper setup needed.

**Alternative: subagent wrapper**

If you prefer manual control over individual skills, create a user-level subagent:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/agents
cp skills/nature-reader/SKILL.md ~/.claude/agents/nature-reader.md
```

Then open `~/.claude/agents/nature-reader.md` and make sure the frontmatter is valid
for Claude Code subagents:

```yaml
---
name: nature-reader
description: Full-paper bilingual, figure-aware, source-grounded Markdown reader for journal or conference papers. Use proactively when the user asks to translate an entire paper or generate a complete markdown reader.
---
```

After that, start a new Claude Code session or open `/agents`, and invoke it naturally or explicitly:

```text
Use the nature-reader subagent to turn this PDF into a full markdown reader.
```

If you prefer commands instead of subagents, create a project or user command under
`.claude/commands/` or `~/.claude/commands/` and paste or adapt the corresponding
`SKILL.md` content there.

Official Claude Code docs:

- [Subagents](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/sub-agents)
- [Slash commands](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/slash-commands)

### 3. Other agents or manual use

If your agent supports reusable prompt files, system prompts, or agent profiles, the minimum
portable unit is the skill directory itself:

```text
skills/nature-<topic>/
├── README.md
├── SKILL.md
└── references/...
```

In that case:

1. Copy the whole skill directory into your prompt library or project.
2. Preserve `SKILL.md` and any `references/` files together.
3. Adapt the frontmatter and body to the target agent's native format if needed.

## nature-figure

**What it does** — Generates multi-panel matplotlib figures that match *Nature* journal
visual standards: correct typography, semantic colour palette, editable SVG output,
and non-redundant panel information architecture.

**Example output gallery** — Five dense, simulated *Nature*-style result figures are
included in the [`nature-figure` gallery](skills/nature-figure/README.md#example-output-gallery):
material/mechanism, spatial imaging, in vivo efficacy, single-cell systems and
perturbation validation.

**Chart-type atlas** — The [`nature-figure` chart atlas](skills/nature-figure/README.md#chart-type-atlas)
classifies 10 supported chart families, including bar, line, heatmap, scatter/bubble,
radar/polar, distribution, forest/interval, area/stacked, image-plate and network/matrix
layouts.

| ![Material design and physical validation](skills/nature-figure/assets/gallery/fig1-material-mechanism-rich.png) | ![Spatial imaging and uptake](skills/nature-figure/assets/gallery/fig2-spatial-imaging-rich.png) | ![In vivo efficacy and tolerability](skills/nature-figure/assets/gallery/fig3-in-vivo-efficacy-rich.png) | ![Single-cell systems figure](skills/nature-figure/assets/gallery/fig4-single-cell-systems-rich.png) | ![Perturbation validation](skills/nature-figure/assets/gallery/fig5-validation-perturbation-rich.png) |
|---|---|---|---|---|

**Built from** — Production scripts from papers published in *Nature Machine Intelligence*
and top ML/bioinformatics venues ([figures4papers](https://github.com/ChenLiu-1996/figures4papers)).
The figures4papers demo scripts and preview assets are bundled inside
`skills/nature-figure/assets/figures4papers/`, with a routing guide at
`skills/nature-figure/references/demos.md`.

**Key rules enforced**

- Three mandatory rcParams must always appear first:
  ```python
  plt.rcParams['font.family'] = 'sans-serif'
  plt.rcParams['font.sans-serif'] = ['Arial', 'DejaVu Sans', 'Liberation Sans']
  plt.rcParams['svg.fonttype'] = 'none'   # text stays as <text> nodes, not paths
  ```
- Primary output is always `.svg`; `.png` at 300 dpi is a secondary raster preview.
- Multi-panel figures follow a three-level information hierarchy: **overview → deviation → relationship**. No two panels may answer the same scientific question.

## nature-polishing

**What it does** — Transforms academic draft text (including Chinese → English translation)
into prose matching *Nature* journal conventions: ≤ 30-word sentences, section-aware
tense and hedging, precise vocabulary, correct citation practice, and British English.

**Built from** — A graduate-level scientific English writing course, Academic Phrasebank,
and close reading of curated *Nature* and *Nature Communications* research articles
across materials, energy systems, construction decarbonization and machine learning.

**Key rules enforced**

| Domain | Core rule |
|--------|-----------|
| Sentence length | Every sentence ≤ 30 words; count individually; last sentence most likely to fail |
| Hedging calibration | Match claim strength to evidence: *demonstrate* → *suggest* → *may reflect* |
| Section tense | Results = past tense + quantitative detail; Discussion = hedging + mechanism |
| Citation integrity | Cite only sources personally read and verified; four attribution types |
| Overclaim detection | Flag absolutes, unwarranted causation, scope expansion, unverified "first" claims |
| British English | signalling, colour, analyse, programme, modelling, behaviour |

**12-step polishing workflow**

Sentence split → Section ID → Hourglass check → Tense audit → Sentence edit →
Vocabulary upgrade → Template check → Citation audit → House style → Overclaim →
Proofreading → Plain-text output

## nature-writing

**What it does** — Drafts or rebuilds manuscript sections from author-provided
claims, results, figures, notes, or Chinese drafts. It is for argument construction:
abstracts, introductions, Results narratives, Discussions, Conclusions, titles and
full manuscript outlines, method sections, experiment sections and reviewer-facing
self-review.

**Built from** — Close reading of curated *Nature* and *Nature Communications*
articles, especially how published papers move from field-scale stakes to a narrow
gap, then to evidence, interpretation and bounded implication. It also integrates
open research-writing notes for paragraph flow, section logic and adversarial
paper review.

**Key rules enforced**

| Domain | Core rule |
|--------|-----------|
| Evidence first | Do not invent data, mechanisms, references, statistics, novelty or limitations |
| Abstract | Context/problem → gap → approach → key result → implication → boundary |
| Introduction | Field scale → bottleneck → prior attempts → unresolved gap → present study |
| Method | Module motivation → module design → forward process → technical advantage |
| Results | Build an evidence ladder, not a chronological lab diary |
| Experiments | Tie claims to baselines, ablations, metrics, stress tests and readable tables |
| Discussion | Explain meaning, relation to prior work, constraints and future use |
| Review | Run claim-evidence and rejection-risk checks before submission |
| Chinese notes | Translate intent and argument, not clause order |

## nature-citation

**What it does** — Converts manuscript text or standalone claims into strict Nature / CNS-family
citation candidates, then exports one reference-manager-ready file in `ENW`, `RIS`, or Zotero
`RDF`. It can also generate an HTML screening page for year filtering, citation selection, and
format-specific download.

**Built from** — Crossref metadata retrieval, DOI record export, and journal-family filtering logic
for Nature Portfolio, the AAAS Science family, and Cell Press.

**Key rules enforced**

| Domain | Core rule |
|--------|-----------|
| Scope filtering | Restrict to Nature Portfolio, Science family, Cell Press, or flagship-only journals |
| Segmentation | Split long text into citable claim units with stable segment IDs |
| Search discipline | Translate Chinese claims into English scientific concepts; prefer precision over volume |
| Support grading | Distinguish strong, partial, background, limiting, and metadata-only support |
| Export integrity | Do not fabricate DOI, pages, volume, issue, or journal metadata |
| Download options | Support one-file export in `ENW`, `RIS`, or Zotero `RDF` |

**Reference files**

```text

├── README.md
├── SKILL.md
├── references/
│   ├── journal-scope.md
│   ├── ris-endnote.md
│   └── search-strategy.md
└── scripts/
    └── nature_citation.py
```

**Example workflow** — Segment a paragraph, search in-scope citations, review candidates in the
HTML browser, then download only the selected records as `ENW`, `RIS`, or Zotero `RDF`.

---

## nature-data

**What it does** — Prepares and audits Data Availability statements, repository plans,
dataset citations, and FAIR metadata checks for Nature-family and Springer Nature
submissions. It is bilingual-aware: Chinese author notes such as "data availability statement",
"request from corresponding author", "raw data", "restricted data", and "public database" are converted into precise
submission-ready English with Chinese action notes.

**Built from** — Springer Nature research data policy, Nature Portfolio reporting standards,
Scientific Data repository and citation practice, the FAIR Guiding Principles, and DataCite
metadata conventions.

**Key rules enforced**

| Domain | Core rule |
|--------|-----------|
| Data Availability | Map every result-supporting dataset to a durable access route |
| Repository strategy | Prefer mandated or discipline-specific repositories with persistent identifiers |
| Restricted data | State the restriction reason, controller, review route, and access conditions |
| Dataset citations | Cite public datasets with DataCite-style creator, title, repository, year, and identifier metadata |
| FAIR metadata | Check identifiers, licence, README/data dictionary, provenance, version, and reuse conditions |
| Chinese alignment | Translate intent rather than literal wording; flag vague "reasonable request" phrasing |

**Reference files**

---

## nature-response

**What it does** — Drafts, audits, and revises point-by-point reviewer response
letters for Nature-family and high-impact journal manuscript revisions. It treats the
response letter as an editor-facing verification document: every reviewer concern is assigned
a stable ID, classified, mapped to an action, and tied to manuscript evidence, a revision
location, or an unresolved author-input flag.

**Built from** — Nature editorial process guidance, Nature-family revision-package
instructions, Springer Nature rebuttal advice, and transparent peer-review considerations.

**Key rules enforced**

| Domain | Core rule |
|--------|-----------|
| Completeness | Every reviewer comment receives an ID and a response, cross-reference, or unresolved flag |
| Action mapping | Each reply maps to a concrete manuscript action such as `ACCEPT_TEXT`, `ACCEPT_ANALYSIS`, `SOFTEN_CLAIM`, or `AUTHOR_INPUT_NEEDED` |
| Traceability | Claimed changes must cite a section, page, line, figure, table, supplement, citation, or visible placeholder |
| Factuality | Do not invent experiments, analyses, citations, line numbers, figure panels, editor instructions, or manuscript changes |
| Tone | Use cooperative, evidence-forward language; disagree only with scientific or scope-based reasoning |
| Chinese alignment | Convert Chinese author notes into English response prose plus Chinese confirmation items when needed |

## nature-paper2ppt

**What it does** — Turns a scientific paper, preprint, PDF, article text, abstract,
figure legends, or reading notes into a concise Chinese `.pptx` presentation for journal
club, group meeting, lab meeting, paper sharing, or thesis seminar.

The skill identifies the paper type and central argument, selects only figures and tables
that support the evidence chain, writes Chinese slide titles, bullets, captions, takeaways
and speaker notes, creates the actual PPTX deck, and runs lightweight package QA.

**Key rules enforced**

| Domain | Core rule |
|--------|-----------|
| Narrative | Use the paper's scientific argument as the slide spine, not the manuscript section order |
| Paper type | Classify the paper before choosing claim-first, problem-to-solution, workflow-to-validation, or evidence-map logic |
| Figures | Use figures as evidence; crop or split dense panels rather than shrinking them into unreadable slots |
| Output | Build a real `.pptx` as the primary deliverable, with Chinese text and speaker notes |
| QA | Reopen or inspect the PPTX package, record slide count, embedded media, notes, and any rendering limits |
| Integrity | Do not fabricate results, methods, numbers, datasets, mechanisms, or figure details |

## nature-academic-search

**What it does** — Provides a multi-source academic search and reference-management
workflow backed by a local MCP server. It searches PubMed, CrossRef and arXiv in
parallel, fetches records by DOI, PMID or arXiv ID, formats citations, looks up MeSH
terms, verifies bibliographic identifiers, and supports `.nbib`, `.ris`, `.bib` and
`.enw` reference-file workflows.

**Built from** — A unified MCP server with source adapters for PubMed E-utilities,
CrossRef REST metadata and arXiv Atom metadata, plus reusable workflow notes for
source-tier routing, search strategy, citation parsing, deduplication, RIS/BibTeX
field mapping and reference-file conversion.

**Setup note** — For Claude Code MCP use, run
`bash skills/nature-academic-search/install.sh your-email@example.com`, restart Claude Code,
and optionally set `NCBI_API_KEY` for higher PubMed rate limits. For plain prompt use,
copy the whole `skills/nature-academic-search/` directory like the other skills.

**Key rules enforced**

| Domain | Core rule |
|--------|-----------|
| Source routing | Start with structured API-backed sources: PubMed for biomedical searches, CrossRef for DOI and cross-disciplinary metadata, and arXiv for preprints |
| Fallback discipline | Escalate from T1 sources to limited APIs or scraped/manual sources only when needed, and warn when results may be incomplete |
| Deduplication | Merge multi-source hits by DOI, PMID, arXiv ID and normalized title rather than counting duplicate records as separate evidence |
| Citation verification | Resolve DOI, PMID and arXiv IDs before citation formatting; expose missing or failed metadata instead of filling fields by guesswork |
| MeSH strategy | Use MeSH lookup for biomedical PubMed queries when the task needs recall, controlled vocabulary or systematic search structure |
| File integrity | Preserve bibliographic fields when converting `.nbib`, `.ris`, `.bib` and `.enw`; do not fabricate volume, issue, pages, DOI or PMID values |

**MCP tools**

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `search_papers` | Search CrossRef, PubMed and arXiv with optional source selection and per-source result limits |
| `get_paper_by_id` | Fetch paper metadata by DOI, PMID or arXiv ID with automatic ID-type detection |
| `get_citation` | Generate formatted citations in styles such as APA, Nature, IEEE, Vancouver, Chicago and MLA |
| `lookup_mesh` | Query PubMed MeSH descriptors for biomedical search-term expansion |

**Example workflow** — Search the same topic across PubMed, CrossRef and arXiv, merge
and deduplicate candidate papers, verify key identifiers, look up MeSH terms for the
biomedical subset, then export or convert the selected references for Zotero, EndNote
or BibTeX.

## Shared design principles

All skills in this collection adhere to the following:

1. **Primary sources only** — rules are grounded in published *Nature* content or official
   journal guidelines, not general style preference.
2. **Explicit over implicit** — every rule is stated with a rationale, not just asserted.
3. **Section-aware** — academic writing and figures both require context-sensitivity;
   each skill applies different logic depending on which part of a paper is being handled.
4. **Output-first** — every skill returns something immediately usable: copy-paste prose,
   a `.svg` file, a `.pptx` deck, or a concrete recommendation. No intermediate planning documents.
5. **Extensible by design** — each skill is self-contained in its own directory; adding a
   new skill requires no changes to existing ones.

---

## Adding a new skill

To add a skill to this collection:

**1. Create a directory**
```
skills/nature-<topic>/
```

**2. Minimum required files**

| File | Required | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| `SKILL.md` | Yes | Frontmatter (`name`, `description`) + rules + workflow; loaded by the agent after triggering |
| `README.md` | Yes | Human-readable reference in full English |
| `references/*.md` | Recommended for complex skills | Modular rule files (api, design theory, tutorials, chart types, …) |

**3. SKILL.md frontmatter template**
```yaml
---
name: nature-<topic>
description: >-
  One-sentence description of what the skill does and when to trigger it.
  Include the output format and the primary use case.
---
```

**4. Update this index**

Add a row to the [Skill index](#skill-index) table above:
```markdown
| [`nature-<topic>`](skills/nature-<topic>/README.md) | Draft / Stable | One-line purpose | trigger keywords |
```

**5. Status labels**

| Label | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `Draft` | Rules defined; not yet tested on real examples |
| `Beta` | Tested on examples; edge cases may remain |
| `Stable` | Validated on real academic content; rules are settled |

---

## Candidate skills (not yet built)

The following are documented gaps. Contributions welcome.

| Candidate | Scope | Priority |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| `nature-stats` | Statistical reporting conventions for *Nature* (effect sizes, confidence intervals, p-value formatting, sample size statements) | High |
| `nature-methods` | Deep-dive Methods writing assistant — reproducibility checklist, forbidden phrases, ethical approval templates, supplementary organisation | Medium |
| `nature-cover` | Cover letter drafting — hook paragraph, significance framing, fit-to-journal argument, ≤ 500-word limit | Medium |
| `nature-review` | Writing a literature review or review article in *Nature Reviews* style — synthesis vs. summary, argument-led structure | Low |
